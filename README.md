## What Solon Does

- **Puts public finances on-chain.** Every treasury transaction is tracked against a multi-sig Bitcoin wallet. Amounts stored in satoshis as BigInt — no floating point, no rounding errors, no trust required.
- **Makes decisions auditable.** Laws and governance decisions are cryptographically signed, linked to voting sessions, and tracked against measurable KPIs.
- **Opens procurement to competition.** Service requests and bids live in the open. Vendor performance is scored, not assumed.
- **Replaces trust with math.** Votes are signed with Bitcoin keys, verified cryptographically, and enforced as one-member-one-vote per session.

## Architecture

Solon is built on four pillars. Each pillar maps to a domain in the codebase and a set of Prisma models that serve as the single source of truth.

### The Four Pillars

**1. Transparent Transaction System** — `prisma/schema.prisma: BitcoinTransaction, BudgetAllocation`

All organizational finances route through Bitcoin. Organizations carry an `xpub` field for multi-sig wallet derivation. Budget allocations reference transactions by ID, creating an auditable chain from proposal to spend.

**2. Law Transparency Framework** — `prisma/schema.prisma: Decision`

Decisions link to the voting session that produced them. Each carries a `kpiTracking` JSON field for effectiveness measurement after passage. No decision exists without a recorded vote.

**3. Open Service Marketplace** — `prisma/schema.prisma: ServiceRequest, ServiceBid`

Procurement is open by default. Service requests publish requirements; bids compete on merit. Vendor performance feeds back into future evaluations.

**4. Open Vote System** — `prisma/schema.prisma: VotingSession, Vote`

Votes are cryptographically signed (`signature` field on Vote). One vote per member per session, enforced by a unique constraint on `[sessionId, memberId]`. Sessions support multiple mechanisms: `SIMPLE_MAJORITY`, `SUPERMAJORITY`, `CONSENSUS`, `RANKED_CHOICE`.

### Schema as SSOT

The Prisma schema defines 10 models. Types, validation, and API contracts derive from it — nothing is defined twice.

```
Organization  ── has many ──> Member
     │                          │
     ├── BitcoinTransaction     ├── Vote (signed, unique per session)
     ├── BudgetAllocation       │
     ├── VotingSession ─────────┘
     ├── Decision (linked to VotingSession)
     ├── ServiceRequest
     └── ServiceBid
```

Key design decisions:
- Organizations define a `governanceModel` enum: `DEMOCRATIC | CONSENSUS | DELEGATED`
- Members carry `bitcoinAddress` and `votingWeight` (defaults to 1.0)
- All monetary amounts are `BigInt` satoshis — `amountSats` on transactions, `allocatedSats` / `spentSats` on budgets

### Transparency Engine

A computation layer scores every organization across five dimensions (0-100 each):

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Financial Transparency | On-chain transaction coverage vs. total spend |
| Decision Auditability | Percentage of decisions with linked voting sessions |
| Participation Rate | Active voters vs. eligible members |
| Corruption Risk | Inverse score — flags concentration of spending authority |
| Cost Efficiency | Bid competitiveness and budget adherence |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript 5.5 (strict mode) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM |
| Bitcoin | BTCPay Server / Bitcoin Core (stubbed in MVP) |
| Testing | Playwright E2E + Puppeteer smoke tests |
| i18n | English, German, French, Italian |

## Route Map

**Marketing pages:** `/`, `/features`, `/security`, `/integration`, `/about`, `/governance/voting`

**Dashboard:** `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/voting`, `/treasury/bitcoin`

**API:**
- `GET /api/bitcoin/wallet/[orgId]` — wallet balance and transaction history
- `PUT /api/bitcoin/wallet/[orgId]` — update wallet configuration
- `POST /api/voting/[sessionId]/cryptographic-vote` — submit a signed vote
- `GET /api/voting/[sessionId]/cryptographic-vote` — retrieve vote tally

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/solon.git
cd solon
npm install

# Set up the database
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL connection string
npx prisma migrate dev

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The dashboard is at `/dashboard`.

**Run tests:**

```bash
# E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Smoke tests
npx puppeteer test
```

## Roadmap

**Now (MVP):** Pillars 1 and 4 scaffolded. Bitcoin integrations stubbed for local development. Transparency engine computes scores from seed data.

**Next:**
- Live BTCPay Server integration for real transaction tracking
- Cryptographic vote verification against Bitcoin key pairs
- Multi-sig wallet support via descriptor wallets
- Service marketplace with bid evaluation scoring

**Later:**
- Federated governance across organizations
- On-chain decision anchoring (OP_RETURN or Taproot)
- Mobile-first voting interface
- Delegation chains with revocation
